Welcome to My Polymer site!

To begin, fire up a local server from inside the `app` directory. Please make sure to serve up the contents of the directory rather than root as routing will otherwise fail to correctly function.

## Firing up a server using Python

On a Linux machine, run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

You can of course also use WAMP or an alternative tool for serving up content.
